## NAMD LAB 2: BUILDING AND SIMULATING A PROTEIN-BILAYER SYSTEM
###### by [Mitch Gleed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-gleed-65a8b03b/)

#### Objectives:
- Learn to create a protein-bilayer system using the CHARMM-GUI membrane builder 
- Learn how to run pre-made CHARMM-GUI dynamics scripts 

---

In this lab we will be working with the same protein that we simulated in CHARMM labs 7 and 8, the Influenza A M2 protein. We construct the protein-bilayer system using CHARMM-GUI, a CHARMM web interface developed by Lehigh University. We will then use NAMD to equilibrate, CHARMM to insert a drug of choice, VMD to create comparison sets for NAMD restraints, and then perform production dynamics in NAMD. 

This lab is a preparation lab for the Umbrella Sampling lab, which will use trajectories you simulate in this lab and rely heavily on code you create as well. To this end, there are actually a few points of flexibility in the lab, so depending on if you are doing this lab with other students in a class setting, you might each pick slightly different, but related, options so that you can compare results in the end (like a small research study!). Take a moment with your class and decide what each class member will do differently and what variables should remain the same. Here are just a few of many examples of components where you will have flexibility:
- **M2 PDB**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of a particular M2 blocker between different M2 structures on the protein data bank.
- **M2 protonation state**. Ex: Compare the free-energy profiles of a particular M2 blocker with varying His37 protonation states (count, type).
- **M2 mutations**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of a particular M2 blocker between WT, S31N, V27A variants of the same M2 structure.
- **M2 blockers**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of varying M2 blockers, such as Amantadine, Rimantadine, etc. with the same M2 structure.
- **Restraints**. Ex: Investigate the impact of varying strengths of peptide backbone restraints on a specific drug's free-energy profile with the same M2 structure.

### 1. CHARMM-GUI 

Navigate to [http://www.charmm-gui.org](http://www.charmm-gui.org). Select `Input Generator` in the navigation bar, then select `Membrane Builder` > `Bilayer Builder` in the updated navigation bar. Scroll down to `Protein/Membrane System` and enter the M2 PDB protein code of your choice. Average structures have been built for all of the following structures--for the sake of ease you may choose between these, otherwise you will need to modify the restraint protocol used in this lab involving averaged PDB structures.

! Equilibration
!------------------------------------------------------------------------
! To reduce the possible problem with the numerical integration with
! the uncorrelated system, 1 fs time-step is used only for the first-step of 
! equilibration. 
! It is still possible that you may need to use 1 fs for the next equilibration
! steps if your system is initially very very unstable (rare cases).
!
! ** Note: change "nstep" to reduce the number of dynamics steps
