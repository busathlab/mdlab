#### Objectives:
- Learn to create a protein-bilayer system using the CHARMM-GUI membrane builder 
- Learn how to run pre-made CHARMM-GUI dynamics scripts 

---

In this lab we will be working with the same protein that we simulated in CHARMM labs 7 and 8, the Influenza A M2 protein. We construct the protein-bilayer system using CHARMM-GUI, a CHARMM web interface developed by Lehigh University. We will then use NAMD to equilibrate, CHARMM to insert a drug of choice, VMD to create comparison sets for NAMD restraints, and then perform production dynamics in NAMD. 

This lab is a preparation lab for the Umbrella Sampling lab, which will use trajectories you simulate in this lab and rely heavily on code you create as well. To this end, there are actually a few points of flexibility in the lab, so depending on if you are doing this lab with other students in a class setting, you might each pick slightly different, but related, options so that you can compare results in the end (like a small research study!). Take a moment with your class and decide what each class member will do differently and what variables should remain the same. Here are just a few of many examples of components where you will have flexibility:
- **M2 PDB**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of a particular M2 blocker between different M2 structures on the protein data bank.
- **M2 protonation state**. Ex: Compare the free-energy profiles of a particular M2 blocker with varying His37 protonation states (count, type) of the same M2 structure.
- **M2 mutations**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of a particular M2 blocker between WT, S31N, V27A variants of the same M2 structure.
- **M2 blockers**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of varying M2 blockers, such as Amantadine, Rimantadine, etc. with the same M2 structure.
- **M2 blocker properties**. Ex: Compare free-energy profiles of deprotonated vs. protonated or L- vs. R-chiral M2 blockers with the same M2 structure.
- **Restraints**. Ex: Investigate the impact of varying strengths of peptide backbone restraints on a specific drug's free-energy profile with the same M2 structure.
- **Membrane composition**. Ex: Investigate the impact of varying lipid membrane composition on the free-energy profile of a specific M2 blocker with the same M2 structure.

### 1. CHARMM-GUI 

Navigate to [http://www.charmm-gui.org](http://www.charmm-gui.org). Select `Input Generator` in the navigation bar, then select `Membrane Builder` > `Bilayer Builder` in the updated navigation bar. Scroll down to `Protein/Membrane System` and enter the M2 PDB protein code of your choice. Average structures have been built for all of the following structures--for the sake of ease you may choose between these, otherwise you will need to modify the restraint protocol used in this lab involving averaged PDB structures.

- **2LY0**. [Solution NMR structure of the influenza A virus S31N mutant (19-49) in presence of drug M2WJ332](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1315)
- **2L0J**. [Solid State NMR structure of the M2 proton channel from Influenza A Virus in hydrated lipid bilayer](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6003/509)
- **2L0J S31N**. Generated by CHARMM-GUI from the above structure 
- **2KIX**. [Channel domain of BM2 protein from influenza B virus](https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.1707)
- **2KQT**. [Solid-state NMR structure of the M2 transmembrane peptide of the influenza A virus in DMPC lipid bilayers bound to deuterated amantadine](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08722)
- **2KQT S31N**. Generated by CHARMM-GUI from the above structure. Used in some of our lab's publications, including [Gleed, et al. 2015](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b05808).

Once you have entered the PDBID of your choice, ensure `Download Source` is set to "OPM", and then scroll down to and click `Next Step: Select Model/Chain`.

#### Select Model/Chain 
- Model 1 should be selected and `Read all models?` should be unchecked
- Only protein segments should be checked (`Hetero` should all be unchecked)

#### Manipulate PDB 
All of the boxes here should be unchecked except for the following: 
- Terminal group patching. The four M2 segments should be patched at the N and C termini by default when checked. 
- Mutation. Here is where you can mutate certain residues, e.g. Ser 31 -> Asn 31. Ensure you mutate all four segments (PROA, PROB, PROC, PROD). **You also use this to set His protonation, see discussion below.** Click on `Add Mutation` to add more mutations.

The protonation box is limited, and we prefer to use the mutation feature to set His protonation states. You must set His protonation for all occurences in the peptide. For example, the 2KQT structure has one His residue on each M2 segment, for a total of four; 2L0J, on the other hand, has two on each segment, for a total of eight. We have used the HSE epsilon protonation state for His37 in our lab publications, so we suggest you use that here.

For 2KQT, it should look like the following: 

| SEGID | RESID | AA  | Mut |
| ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
| PROA  | 37    | HIS | HSE |
| PROB  | 37    | HIS | HSE |
| PROC  | 37    | HIS | HSE |
| PROD  | 37    | HIS | HSE |

#### Generate PDB and Orient Molecule
- If using an OPM orientation of the PDB (set in the first step when you entered the PDB ID), select `Use PDB Orientation`, otherwise select `Align the First Principal Axis Along Z`
- Check `Generate Por Water and Measure Pore Size`

#### Calculate Cross-Sectional Area
In this portion, you will decide which type of lipids to use and what type and size of system you want. 

- Under `1. Box Type`, select `Hexagonal`. You can elect to use `Rectangular`, but for the purposes of this lab we will add the ability to manage a hexagonal simulation crystal to your repetoire, should you choose to use one or find a need to use one in your simulations. Hexagonal boxes reduce the size of a protein-bilayer system without compromising results, as it gets rid of water and lipids most distant from the central protein. For most purposes, however, probably including in publications, we recommend using a rectagonal box, as this is the standard.
- Leave `2. Length of Z based on` and `3. Length of XY based on` default, but take a look at what these are adjusting. 
- Enter `60` in the box after `Length of X and Y`
- Click the arrowhead next to `PC (phosphatidylcholine ) Lipids` and enter `1` in the boxes under the headings `Upperleaflet Ratio (Integer)` and `Lowerleaflet Ratio (Integer)` for the lipid `DMPC`.
- Click the button `Show the system info`. A table on the right side of the page now appears and provides some data regarding the membrane to be constructed.

As far as the membrane lipid composition goes, you will generally want to choose a lipid according to the lipid used in the study connected to the PDB. If you want to use this as a comparison in the umbrella sampling study, you could use homogenous membranes with varying lipids or varying mixtures of lipids, cholesterol, etc. by changing the lipid ratios in the upper and lower membrane leaflets.

Equilibration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To reduce the possible problem with the numerical integration with
the uncorrelated system, 1 fs time-step is used only for the first-step of 
equilibration. 
It is still possible that you may need to use 1 fs for the next equilibration
steps if your system is initially very very unstable (rare cases).

** Note: change "nstep" to reduce the number of dynamics steps
